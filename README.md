## ðŸ“Š Analysis
We analyzed the companyâ€™s **Quarterly Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) Growth** for 2024:

| Quarter | MRR Growth |
|---------|------------|
| Q1      | 7.06       |
| Q2      | 10.42      |
| Q3      | 8.80       |
| Q4      | 7.94       |

- **Average MRR Growth:** **8.56**  
- **Industry Benchmark Target:** **15**

## ðŸ“‰ Key Findings
- The companyâ€™s growth (8.56) is **significantly below** the industry benchmark (15).  
- Growth peaked in **Q2** (10.42) but fell back in Q3 and Q4.  
- Consistent underperformance indicates structural growth challenges.  

## ðŸ’¡ Business Implications
- At the current growth rate, the company risks **losing market share**.  
- Investors may perceive the company as **underperforming** relative to competitors.  
- Strategic shifts are required to accelerate revenue expansion.  

## ðŸš€ Recommendations
To close the gap and reach the industry target of 15, we recommend:  
1. **Expand into new market segments** â€“ target untapped industries and geographies.  
2. **Enhance customer retention** â€“ reduce churn through better support & engagement.  
3. **Upsell and cross-sell** â€“ increase ARPU (average revenue per user).
